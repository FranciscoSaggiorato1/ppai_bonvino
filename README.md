**Practical Application Integrator Project - UTN-FRC - DSI**

Welcome to **Bonvino**, a project developed as part of the Practical Application Integrator Project at the Facultad Regional Córdoba of the Universidad Tecnológica Nacional (UTN-FRC). This repository contains all the source code and documentation for creating an innovative application that blends technology and enology.

## Project Description

Bonvino is an application designed to enhance the experience of wine enthusiasts by providing a platform where users can discover, rate, and comment on various wines. The application includes features such as:

- **Wine Catalog**: A comprehensive database with detailed descriptions of wines from different wineries.
- **Reviews and Ratings**: Users can leave their opinions and ratings for the wines they have tasted.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Algorithms that suggest wines based on user preferences.
- **Events and Tastings**: Information about local wine-related events.
- **User Profile**: Each user can manage their profile, view their tasting history, and save their favorites.

## Technologies Used

The Bonvino project is developed using a combination of modern technologies to ensure a robust and efficient application. Key technologies include:

- **Frontend**: React.js for an interactive and dynamic user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for server and API development.
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible and scalable data storage.
- **Authentication**: Secure authentication and authorization using JWT.
- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization and cloud deployment.
